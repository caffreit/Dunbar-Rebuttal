# Dunbar-Rebuttal
Rebuttal of results from R. Dunbar

I was sent a paper written by Robin Dunbar. It used Finnish CDR data to find evidence for the existence of social layers. It is bollocks, and shocking display of confirmation bias. Here I replicate the results using random data generated from a lognormal distribution. The results are artefacts produced by fitting to the noise inherent to individual level data.
